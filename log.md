# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

### Day 1: May 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed conditional statements, type conversion, and format strings. Completed the Day 2 lessons and did the Day 3 text adventure project before going through the lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am pretty good at figuring out the logic behind various coding problems, it is just going to take some time to re-learn the Python syntax since I haven't programmed in quite a while.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
