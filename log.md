# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
