# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

### Day 1: May 24, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed conditional statements, type conversion, and format strings. Completed the Day 2 lessons and did the Day 3 text adventure project before going through the lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am pretty good at figuring out the logic behind various coding problems, it is just going to take some time to re-learn the Python syntax since I haven't programmed in quite a while.

### Day 2: May 25, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 3, 4, and 5, and completed the projects for Days 4, 5, and 6.
Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- lists
- random module
- for loops and while loops
- range() function
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Password generator
- Robot maze escape

**Thoughts** I've been able to complete the end of day projects before taking the lessons for the day, which shows I am still reviewing topics that I previously knew. It is encouraging that I am picking it back up so quickly.

### Day 3: May 26, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining lessons from Day 6, and completed additional practice problems on Reeborg's World.

Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- while loops
- functions

**Thoughts**: Didn't get nearly as much time to go through lessons and practice problems as yesterday. Solved all of the Hurdle problems, and realized my solution for the Maze problem could be used for the Hurdles as well.

### Day 4: May 27, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 7 and 8.
Topics reviewed:
- functions (with positional arguments and with keyword arguments)
- creating modules
- importing modules
- ASCII art
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Hangman
- Caeser cipher (encode/decode)

**Thoughts**: The logic behind the projects was pretty straightforward. The user interface elements and adding sanitization to areas with user input made the projects take a bit longer.

### Day 5: May 28, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 9. Solved additional Reeborg's World puzzles.
Topics reviewed:
- dictionaries
- nesting lists and dictionaries
- input validation

Reeborg's World puzzles solved:
- Home 1
- Home 2
- Home 3
- Home 4
- Around 1
- Around 1 - variable
- Around 1 - apple
- Around 2
- Around 3
- Around 4
- Center 1
- Center 2
- Harvest 1
- Harvest 2

Mini Projects completed:
- Caesar Cipher (improved from Day 8)
- Secret Bid Auction

**Thoughts**: Reeborg's World is a pretty fun way to practice various coding concepts and see the code in action. I would definitely recommend it to beginners (even kids). The Secret Bid Auction was a very easy project, so I extended it to add input validation, and included functionality to detect tie bids and list out all of the tied winners.

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the lessons and the project from Day 10.
Topics reviewed:
- functions (with returns)
- eval()
- modules

Mini Projects completed:
- Calculator

**Thoughts**: Went through some lessons at the beginning of the day, but didn't get much opportunity to program. I was able to complete the Calculator project though.

### Day 7: May 30, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Blackjack project (Capstone #1) for Day 11.
Topics reviewed:
- lists
- functions
- random module
- type conversions
- input sanitization
- while loops

Capstone Project completed:
- Blackjack
- --> added tracking of win/lose/draw statistics
- --> added bankroll and betting
- --> added realistic deck with removal of cards and shuffling

**Thoughts**: The Blackjack project was really fun, but fairly easy. I added a lot of extra functionality to challenge myself and make it more realistic and enjoyable.

### Day 8: May 31, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 12, 13, and 14, and completed projects from Days 12 and 14.

Mini Projects completed:
- Guess the Number game
- Higher or Lower game

**Thoughts**: Number Guessing game and Higher or Lower game were both very easy to implement without needing to make an outline or flow chart. They each took less than 30 minutes to create, including some modifications I made. The debugging lessons were incredibly basic.
