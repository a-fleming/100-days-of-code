# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

### Day 1: May 24, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed conditional statements, type conversion, and format strings. Completed the Day 2 lessons and did the Day 3 text adventure project before going through the lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am pretty good at figuring out the logic behind various coding problems, it is just going to take some time to re-learn the Python syntax since I haven't programmed in quite a while.

### Day 2: May 25, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 3, 4, and 5, and completed the projects for Days 4, 5, and 6.

Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- lists
- random module
- for loops and while loops
- range() function
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Password generator
- Robot maze escape

**Thoughts** I've been able to complete the end of day projects before taking the lessons for the day, which shows I am still reviewing topics that I previously knew. It is encouraging that I am picking it back up so quickly.

### Day 3: May 26, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining lessons from Day 6, and completed additional practice problems on Reeborg's World.

Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- while loops
- functions

**Thoughts**: Didn't get nearly as much time to go through lessons and practice problems as yesterday. Solved all of the Hurdle problems, and realized my solution for the Maze problem could be used for the Hurdles as well.

### Day 4: May 27, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 7 and 8.

Topics reviewed:
- functions (with positional arguments and with keyword arguments)
- creating modules
- importing modules
- ASCII art
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Hangman
- Caeser cipher (encode/decode)

**Thoughts**: The logic behind the projects was pretty straightforward. The user interface elements and adding sanitization to areas with user input made the projects take a bit longer.

### Day 5: May 28, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 9. Solved additional Reeborg's World puzzles.

Topics reviewed:
- dictionaries
- nesting lists and dictionaries
- input validation

Reeborg's World puzzles solved:
- Home 1
- Home 2
- Home 3
- Home 4
- Around 1
- Around 1 - variable
- Around 1 - apple
- Around 2
- Around 3
- Around 4
- Center 1
- Center 2
- Harvest 1
- Harvest 2

Mini Projects completed:
- Caesar Cipher (improved from Day 8)
- Secret Bid Auction

**Thoughts**: Reeborg's World is a pretty fun way to practice various coding concepts and see the code in action. I would definitely recommend it to beginners (even kids). The Secret Bid Auction was a very easy project, so I extended it to add input validation, and included functionality to detect tie bids and list out all of the tied winners.

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the lessons and the project from Day 10.

Topics reviewed:
- functions (with returns)
- eval()
- modules

Mini Projects completed:
- Calculator

**Thoughts**: Went through some lessons at the beginning of the day, but didn't get much opportunity to program. I was able to complete the Calculator project though.

### Day 7: May 30, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Blackjack project (Capstone #1) for Day 11.

Topics reviewed:
- lists
- functions
- random module
- type conversions
- input sanitization
- while loops

Capstone Project completed:
- Blackjack
- --> added tracking of win/lose/draw statistics
- --> added bankroll and betting
- --> added realistic deck with removal of cards and shuffling

**Thoughts**: The Blackjack project was really fun, but fairly easy. I added a lot of extra functionality to challenge myself and make it more realistic and enjoyable.

### Day 8: May 31, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 12, 13, and 14, and completed projects from Days 12 and 14.

Topics reviewed:
- debugging/debuggers
- random module
- ternary operator
- while loops
- format strings
- functions (with named parameters)
- dictionaries

Mini Projects completed:
- Guess the Number game
- Higher or Lower game

**Thoughts**: Number Guessing game and Higher or Lower game were both very easy to implement without needing to make an outline or flow chart. They each took less than 30 minutes to create, including some modifications I made. The debugging lessons were incredibly basic.

### Day 9: June 1, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 15 and 16.

Topics reviewed:
- IDE setup/configuration
- installing Python packages
- Procedural programming paradigm
- Object-oriented programming paradigm
- Classes
- Class attributes
- Class methods

Mini Projects completed:
- Coffee Maker (procedural)
- Coffee Maker (object-oriented)

**Thoughts**: The process of making the coffe maker program was pretty informative. Although the example program was fairly unsophisticated and lacked checks to prevent invalid user inputs from crashing the program, it gave me a good starting point and provided several features that could be added to make the program more useful and easier to interact with and test. I noticed that for the past few projects I had written several different functions to validate user inputs. I was able to refine these functions and consolidate them into two functions that are much more robust and have optional parameters that can allow them to be used for a variety of different input validation needs. get_valid_string_from_options() and get_valid_int()

### Day 10: June 2, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 17.

Topics reviewed:
- Object-oriented programming paradigm
- APIs
- Classes
- dunder methods
- lists
- dictionaries
- random.sample()

Mini Projects completed:
- Quiz Game (object-oriented)

**Thoughts**: I didn't get too much time today, but I was able to make the quiz on my own using OOP and then refine it a bit more after watching the solution video. The link that was provided to the website with the Trivia question API was really helpful for generating additional questions. The Quiz Game program could definitely be expanded to handle additional types of questions (multiple choice, fill in the blank, etc), as well as add ability for user to specify the types of questions they want to include in the quiz.

### Day 11: June 3, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 18.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- tkinter
- installing Python packages
- tuples
- random.choice()

Mini Projects completed:
- Random walk simulation 
- Dot Painting project

**Thoughts**: I was a bit rushed today and didn't get as much time to focus as I would have liked, but I was able to finish the lessons and the project. I will definitely play around with the Turtle module more in the future for practice.

### Day 12: June 4, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 19.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- event listeners
- state
- higher order functions
- race conditions

Mini Projects completed:
- Etch A Sketch
- Turtle Race

**Thoughts**: I played around with the Turtle module quite a bit. I created the basic Etch A Sketch, and then I modified it so that it worked correctly if you held down the arrow keys (rather than just moving when you press the key). I also added a boost function so you can press the space bar to double the speed. I also added toggle keys that allow you to increase the base speed and angle increment amounts higher and lower.

### Day 13: June 5, 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed project from Day 20 (the first half of the Snake game), but skipped the lessons.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection

Project worked on:
- Snake Game

**Thoughts**: I was a bit rushed today and only got a bit of time to work before bed. I didn't watch any of the video lessons but was able to get the basic of the Snake game done. So far I can make the snake move around the board, and I have a piece of food that gets generated. The collision detection isn't fully working, but if the Snake touches the food, it will be "eaten" and move to a different part of the board. It took some time to research how to properly do animations using event listeners and mainloop() in the Turtle class, because I definitely didn't do it the proper way yesterday. I was able to get the Etch A Sketch to work with an endless while loop, but after further research I found that isn't the ideal way to handle the loop with event listeners. I will have to go back and re-make the Etch A Sketch correctly in the future.

### Day 14: June 6, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed project from Day 21 (the second half of the Snake game), but skipped the lessons.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection
- boundries

Project completed:
- Snake Game

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the rest of the functionality for the Snake game (generate food in correct locations, implement collision detection correctly, detect crash with wall or tail, updating score and writing on the screen, and writing GAME OVER message). I also implemented somewehat of a developer console to allow me to debug things more easily. When I press the "Enter" key, it prompts me for code I want to evaluate, and then runs eval() on my input. This way I can easily check or set values during runtime, as well as running functions. The overall code could definitely use some polishing and refactoring to make it more consice, but that will be for another day.

### Day 15: June 7, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 20 and 21, and completed about 2/3 of the project from Day 22 (Pong) but not the lessons.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection
- boundries
- computer-controlled player

Project worked on:
- Pong

**Thoughts**: Before doing any coding, I took some time to write out the relevant classes, class attributes, and class methods I thought would be necessary to make the Pong game. This was incredibly helpful because it gave me a framework that I could work at filling in, and heped me to see all the parts of the project and how they would interact.

### Day 16: June 8, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson from Day 22 and completed the remainder of the project from Day 22 (Pong). I also revised it quite a bit and added several extra features. I didn't start working on the Day 23 project or lessons.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection (lots of time spent improving this)
- boundries
- computer-controlled player

Project completed:
- Pong

**Thoughts**: I spent an incredible amount of time today tweaking the collision detection for the ball and paddles to improve the gameplay and get rid of some bugs where the ball could go through the paddle if its x velocity got high enough.

### Day 17: June 9, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 2/3 of the Day 23 project (Turtle Crossing game). I didn't go through the lessons, except for the first two lessons which introduced the project and gave some specifications.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- lambda (anonymous functions)

Project worked on:
- Turtle Crossing game

**Thoughts**: I was only able to spend an hour and a half on the project today, so not as long as I would have liked. But I am happy with how much of the project I was able to get done in that time. I pretty much have all of classes implemented that I need. I just need to add collision detection between the cars and the turtle, as well as detect when the turtle reaches the end of the level and then start the next level. I think I will be able to take my GameController class and use it as a default class in the future when I make more games with the Turtle module, which should help speed up some of the basic parts needed to get the initial game loop going.

### Day 18: June 10, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refined much of the work on the Turtle Crossing game and implemented collision detection to end the game, but still need to implement level progression when the player reaches the finish line.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- lambda (anonymous functions)

Project worked on:
- Turtle Crossing game

**Thoughts**: Today I got about an hour and a half of programming. I spend much of the time revising the structure of my code so it makes more sense and better utilizes OOP. I did a couple iterations of collision detection methods, and implemented some additional functionality for testing purposes (allow user to pause the game, show coordinates of Cars and the player when clicked, and allow user to add a car at a specified x and y position). I should be able to finish this project with another hour or less.

### Day 19: June 11, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the rest of the requirements of the Turtle Crossing program (or at least what I thought were the requirements), allowing the level to increase when the finish line is reached, and the player to move back to the start and continue playing. I also included a few aspects of difficulty that increase as the level number increases. The maximum number of cars on screen increases, the probability of spawning a car increases, and the speed of the cars movement increases.

Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- level progression / difficulty

Project completed:
- Turtle Crossing game

**Thoughts**: I was finally able to finish the rest of the game instead of just continuing to revise and improve on certain aspects. The difficulty elements could definitely be refined further, and I could make some modifications so cars only spawn in distinct lanes (rather than any Y value between the start and finish), but at this point I think I learned what was needed for this project and I will move on to future lessons and projects tomorrow.

### Day 20: June 12, 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went back and made one more revision to Turtle Crossing game so that cars are only spawned in distinct lanes that line up with the rows the player can actually land on. After that, I finally went through the lessons from Day 23. I watched the first few Day 24 lessons on file readingwriting and also did the first Day 24 project (revised Snake game to have persistent high score).

Topics reviewed:
- file input/output

Project completed:
- Snake game revision (including persistent high score list)

**Thoughts**: I woke up early this morning and did all of my coding during the first part of the morning when I was fresh. I was definitely able to think more clearly than I typically do late at night with other distractions going on in the room. I was able to review the basics of file system I/O and successfully revise the Snake game to be repeatable, as well as implement a high score list that persists even after the game is closed (by saving the high scores to a file).

### Day 21: June 13, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining lessons from Day 24, as well as project (Mail Merge). Also started going through the Day 25 lessons and reading through the Pandas library.

Topics reviewed:
- file input/output
- .csv files
- csv module
- Pandas library

Project completed:
- Mail Merge

**Thoughts**: The Mail Merge project was incredibly easy once I re-learned how to interact with files. It probably took about 5 minutes to complete. The Pandas library has always seemed a bit daunting to me, so I am excited to jump in and start working with it. It has extensive functionality, as well as good documentation to go along with it.

### Day 22: June 14, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining lessons and project (U.S. States Game) from Day 25.

Topics reviewed:
- file input/output
- .csv files
- csv module
- Pandas library

Project completed:
- U.S. States Quiz game

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if I made the best use of the Pandas library for the state game, since I just used it to read the .csv file and then iterate over the rows of states and add them to my own dictionary (since the .to_dict() method didn't result in the correctly organized dictionary). It might be worth looking to see if there is a built-in way for it to access all of the elements of a row at the same time while iterating through the whole DataFrame (so I could pull out the state name and its corresponding x and y coordinates all at the same time).

### Day 23: June 15, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the lessons and projects from Days 26 and 27.

Topics reviewed:
- file input/output
- .csv files
- list/dictionary comprehension
- Pandas library
- GUIs
- TKinter library

Projects completed:
- NATO alphabet converter
- Miles to Kilometers converter

**Thoughts**: I was able to find the .iterrows() method in the Pandas DataFrame object, which lets me iterate through a DataFrame the way I wanted to yesterday (go row by row and get all the relevant items in the row). I revised the US States quiz to use this new way. I was able to do the NATO alphabet converter very quickly. I wrote up the dictionay and conversion function in the terminal in about 3 minutes, and then just changed it over to a python file and added the user interaction portion. The Mile to Kilometer converter was also very easy to get the required functionality completed. I spent a lot of time learning more about TKinter and revising the converter. I made one version where the input for Miles already has focus, and you are able to run the calculation by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the Calculate button. And for the Calculate button, I added functionality to detect when the mouse hovers over the button or leaves the button, and to increase the size of the border when hovering over the button so that the user gets some visual feedback. I also created another version of the calculator where the conversion is automatically updated as you type (no clicking Calculate or pressing "Enter" needed). You can also enter a Kilometer amount and it will show you the conversion to Miles. TKinter is very robust and is pretty straightforward to use. I think I will use it to make a GUI interface for my Sudoku solver.

### Day 24: June 16, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 2/3 of the Day 28 project (Pomodoro timer). Just need to add functionality to switch back and forth between work and breaks as necessary, and to bring the app back to foreground when timer goes off.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- TKinter grid layout
- Tkinter PhotoImage
- TKinter Canvas
- Event listeners
- Event scheduling

Project worked on:
- Pomodoro timer

**Thoughts**: The logic behind the Pomodoro app is pretty straightforward and simple. The complicated part has been trying to figure out how to make things happen within TKinter. The offical documentation is not great, so I have been reading through several StackOverflow articles and other pages dedicated to TKinter documentation in order to figure out how to do things. It forced me to learn about the TKinter Canvas class in order to be able to show an image and also put text in front of the image. Also, I had to learn about event scheduling (starting and stopping events) with the .after and .after_cancel methods.

### Day 25: June 17, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the rest of the Pomodoro project functionality (switching between work and breaks, bringing the app to foreground when timer goes off, and also playing a sound when timer goes off). However, I introduced a bug that I need to fix. Currently when I start a timer, it shows 1 second less than the set time. Also, the alarm sound doesn't go off until 1 second after the timer already reaches 00:00.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- TKinter grid layout
- TKinter Canvas
- Event listeners
- Event scheduling
- winsound module (for making audible beeps)
- How to bring applications to the foreground programmatically

Project worked on:
- Pomodoro timer

**Thoughts**: It was particularly tricky to find how to make the application come into the foreground of any other open applications when the timer goes off. One method I found seemd like it worked, but it kept the Pomodoro app in the foreground and wouldn't let you click off of it. I went through several StackOverflow answers until I finally found one that worked. I will have to look more into the bugs regarding the missing 1 second when the timer starts and the 1 additional second until the alarm sounds, because I couldn't figure it out today.

### Day 26: June 18, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Day 28 lessons and finished the project. Fixed the bugs in the Pomodoro app so now it correctly shows the full time when the timer is started, and it also shows 00:00 for a second before going to the next timer loop. The beep issue is still present, but I think I may need to use a different method to play sound, since this method takes control of the GUI for the entire duration, which is throwing off the event scheduling.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- TKinter Canvas
- Event scheduling
- winsound module (for making audible beeps)

Project completed:
- Pomodoro timer

**Thoughts**: Tracking down the bugs took quite a while, but I eventually realized that when I completed a work/break session I was immediately calling the function to start the next work/break session. What I really needed to do was schedule it a second in the future so that the 00:00 would show on screen briefly. As far as the wrong initial time showing, that was fixed with the call to start_work() being scheduled a second in the future. I also found out that the winsound module is not asyncronous, but blocks any other code execution at the same time. So I believe that is why the beep was extending the time on the 00:00 screen by a second. I will have to look into different ways of playing sounds, but I won't worry about that for now. I want to move on to the other lessons.

### Day 27: June 19, 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the lessons and project (Password Manager) for Day 29.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- TKinter Frame
- TKinter messagebox module
- Copying text to clipboard
- random module

Project completed:
- Password Manager

**Thoughts**: The project was very straightforward, and I was able to complete all of it without watching the lessons explaining how to do the new concepts. It took some researching to find out how to do certain things, but I was able to figure it out. Some examples were deleting text from an Entry widget, inserting textx into an Entry widget, copying text to the clipboard, having a widget straddle across multiple columns in the grid, giving focus to an Entry widget, using Frame objects to hold other widgets, and using the TKinter messagebox module to create dialog boxes to give messages to the user or request input from the user (specifically Yes/No questions).

### Day 28: June 20, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the lessons and project (Password Manager search function addition) for Day 30.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- JSON
- File I/O
- TKinter messagebox module
- random module

Project improved:
- Password Manager (added Search functionality)

**Thoughts**: It was pretty straightforward to modify the existing Password Manager to read/write the password data using JSON instead of the previous method of writing " | " between each field. Also, adding the Search button functionality and using the try/except blocks to catch exceptions was pretty easy. Thankfully I spent quite a bit of time getting the TKinter layout just right last time, so it was easy to add the Search bar and keep everything else from being impacted negatively.

### Day 29/30: June 21/22, 2024 - Friday/Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the initial lessons and about 2/3 of the capstone project (Flashcard app) for Day 31.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- .csv file I/O
- TKinter Canvas
- TKinter grid layout
- Event listeners
- Higher order functions

Projects worked on:
- Flashcard app (Capstone project)
- Sudoku solver

**Thoughts**: I was out of town this weekend and did't get to spend as much time coding. I didn't have internet access yesterday, so I am including the log for both yesterday and today. I was able to find a word list for the 3,000 most common Spanish words (so I can make the flashcard app for Spanish instead of French), and then used the GOOGLETRANSLATE function inside Google Sheets to translate them into English. And I exported them as a .csv file so I can use them in place of the French words file. I was able to get most of the flashcard app done, I just need to watch some of the video lessons to see how exactly it is supposed to function and keep track of correct/incorrect flashcards. It doesn't really make sense that the right and wrong buttons are on the side of the cards in the foreign language, but instead they should be on the English side so that we can mark if we did or didn't remember the translation. I'm not sure though if the other side should have the buttons removed and should automatically flip after a few seconds, or if there should be a different button to flip the card to the English side.

### Day 31: June 23, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the capstone project (Flashcard app) for Day 31.

Topics reviewed:
- GUIs
- TKinter application loop
- showing/hiding TKinter grid Buttons
- Event listeners
- Higher order functions

Project completed:
- Flashcard app (Capstone project)

**Thoughts**: I got the rest of the required functionality to work on the Flashcard app (removing known cards from the deck, and keeping not known cards in the deck). I also added functionality so the user could restart once they got through all the cards. There is plenty of opportunity to expand this project to include things like saving progression to file, implementing spaced repetition algorithms to show cards at the ideal time, and showing some sort of statistics to the user with things like most missed word, least missed word, number of decks completed, etc.

### Day 32: June 24, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the lessons, finished the mini project (Monday Motivational Quote sender), and started the project (Birthday Wisher) for Day 32.

Topics reviewed:
- smtplib module
- datetime module
- random module

Project worked on:
- Birthday Wisher

**Thoughts**: The smtplib module seems like a good module to use to practice email sending concepts, but from reading through various StackOverflow answers it seems like the email module might be better to work with since it is more robust.

### Day 33: June 25, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining lessons and finished project (Birthday Wisher) for Day 32.

Topics reviewed:
- smtplib module
- random module
- pandas module
- .csv files
- running python in the cloud (pythonanywhere.com)

Project completed:
- Birthday Wisher

**Thoughts**: I finished the project and did some additional research to find out how to get smtplib to send emails with addresses in the To field instead of just bcc. Overall, it still seems pretty clunky, and I probably wouldn't use it much in the future.

### Day 34: June 26, 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed half of the lessons and started the project (ISS Overhead Notifier) for Day 33. Also added functionality to the Day 32 Flashcards capstone to save the remaining un-memorized words to file.

Topics reviewed:
- file I/O
- APIs
- requests module
- datetime module
- raising Exceptions
- JSON

Project worked on:
- ISS Overhead Notifier

**Thoughts**: Working with APIs reminded me my time in Web and Internet Programming class in college. There is definitely a lot that can be done with them, and the requests module makes it pretty easy to interact with them. I am excited to put the module to good use.

### Day 35: June 27, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining lessons and worked more on the project (ISS Overhead Notifier) for Day 33. Completed the Kanye Quote generator mini project and the part of the ISS Notifier that determines if it is night time.

Topics reviewed:
- file I/O
- APIs
- requests module
- datetime module
- raising Exceptions
- JSON

Project worked on:
- ISS Overhead Notifier

**Thoughts**: For some reason the logic behind determining whethether or not it is currently night time was a bit tricky to work out. Becuase the sunrinse and sunsets could be before or after midnight, I couldn't just check for sunset_time <= current_time <= sunrise_time, because if sunrise was after midnight that statement would be False.

### Day 36: June 28, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the the project (ISS Overhead Notifier) for Day 33.

Topics reviewed:
- file I/O
- APIs
- requests module
- datetime module
- raising Exceptions
- JSON
- geocoder module
- smtplib module

Project completed:
- ISS Overhead Notifier

Project worked on:
- Quizzler app

**Thoughts**: There wasn't much left of the project, just to add functionality for the program to send me an email notification when the ISS is overhead and it is night time. Modifying the old QuizGame to use the Trivia website's API instead of manually copying the questions/answers went very smoothly.

### Day 37: June 29, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the the project (Quizzler app) for Day 34 and most of the lessons.

Topics reviewed:
- APIs
- tkinter
- requests module
- html module
- time module
- raising Exceptions
- JSON
- anonymous functions (lambda)

Project completed:
- Quizzler app (GUI)

**Thoughts**: I think I did a good job of implementing the Quizzler app in true OOP form. I separated the quiz logic, quiz interface, and quiz questions into different files with their own respective classes. The Quiz class in the quiz file has a list of Questions, as well as a QuizInterface that handles the GUI.

### Day 38: July 1, 2024 - Monday (skipped Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the lessons and project (Weather SMS) for Day 35.

Topics reviewed:
- APIs
- API key
- requests module
- raising Exceptions
- JSON

Project worked on:
- Weather SMS Notification

**Thoughts**: I didn't get too much time to work on the project or lessons, but it seems pretty straightforward. Once I learn about how to send SMS messages via Python, I should be able to do the rest of the proejct pretty easily.

### Day 39: July 2, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed most of the remaining lessons and the project (Weather SMS) for Day 35, though I was unable to test and verify that the SMS sending portion actually worked.

Topics reviewed:
- APIs
- API key
- Sending SMS messages via Twilio
- running python in the cloud (pythonanywhere.com)

Project completed:
- Weather SMS Notification

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time trying to get a phone number on Twilio to work so that I could send test messages, but after a lot of failed attempts I found there was a note on one of the Day 35 lessons that mentioned that users in the US and Canada are unable to use the Toll-Free phone number provided with a Twilio account in order to send messages due to new restrictions on those type of numbers. The note suggested using the Virtual recipient number provided on Twilio, but that didn't work either. And as a final suggestion it said to use Twilio's WhatsApp messaging API, but that is not available on a trial account, and I did not want to pay to upgrade for something I will not use. It was pretty frustrating, but I think I will finish the video lessons and skip to the next day.

### Day 40: July 4, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining Day 35 lessons. Started the lessons and project (Stock News Alert) for Day 36.

Topics reviewed:
- File I/O
- APIs
- API keys
- requests module

Project worked on:
- Stock News Alert

**Thoughts**: I don't think I will be able to test SMS functionality via Python, so I may need to modify projects going forwards to send myself an email instead of a text message. I only got to start the basic parts of this project, but it doesn't seem too difficult. It is basically using a few different APIs to get information on stocks, and then sending myself a notification when the stock has a big change in the open/close price.

### Day 41: July 6, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the lessons and project (Stock News Alert) for Day 36. Created a SHARED_DATA folder to store data and files that can be used between PyCharm projects.

Topics reviewed:
- File I/O
- APIs
- API keys
- requests module
- smtplib module
- UTF-8 encoding
- JSON

Project completed:
- Stock News Alert

**Thoughts**: I modified the project to send me an email notification when the stock changes meet the required threshold, rather than an SMS. I ran into an issue where the stock API ran out of the 25 free calls that can be made per day. So I had to improvise and make a file with some sample data that I could use for testing purposes while I continued making the rest of the project. I also found myself having to keep remaking helper functions to do basic things like reading API keys from file, as well as the App Password for Gmail. Instead of having to redo this for every project, I found out how I could import files from other directories (by adding those directories to the PyCharm project's root). This allowed me to have a single folder in which I could store the API keys, the App Password, the test email address, as well as my helper.py file that has commonly used functions. This way I only need to update that one file if anything changes, rather than update the files in all my directories.

### Day 42: July 7, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the lessons and project (Habit Tracker) for Day 37.

Topics reviewed:
- Pixela API
- requests module (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON
- datetime strftime() method

Project completed:
- Habit Tracker

**Thoughts**: The project was basically a way to programmatically interface with the Pixela API. Pixela itself handles the habit tracker. Even so, there is plenty that could be done to expand the scope of the project and make it more user friendly. I could make a basic TKinter app that allows you to add coding minutes to a particular date, delete dates, and modify dates. I could potentially have it show an image of the habit tracking graph itself, though that wouldn't provide much information. For more information, I would need to locally pull all of the habit tracker data, and have functionality added so that when a certain date is hovered over it shows the quantity of coding minutes for that date. It would be fairly straightforward to do, but I'm not very interested in doing it because I don't actually see myself using this app.

### Day 43: July 8, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3/4 of the lessons and 3/4 of the project (Workout Tracker) for Day 38.

Topics reviewed:
- Nutritionix API (for computing calories burned from exercises)
- Sheety API (for interacting w/Google Sheets)
- requests module
- JSON
- datetime strftime() method

Project worked on:
- Workout Tracker

**Thoughts**: Most of this project consisted of linking different API calls together. The Nutritionix API handled all of the natural language processing of the exercises provided by the user, and returned the duration and calories burned. The Sheetly API allowed us to read from/write to our Google Sheet. So really all our program did was prompt the user and then make two API calls. I didn't realize that the project included securing our Sheetly API with a means of authentication, so I will do that tomorrow.

### Day 44: July 9, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining lessons and finished the project (Workout Tracker) for Day 38.

Topics reviewed:
- Sheety API (for interacting w/Google Sheets)
- requests module
- JSON
- Token authentication

Project completed:
- Workout Tracker

**Thoughts**: I chose to use the "Bearer" (token) method of authorization instead of the "Basic" authentication using username/password. It was fairly easy to implement. I just needed to generate a complex token, add it to the authentication settings on Sheetly, and then have my API call include the token in the header.
