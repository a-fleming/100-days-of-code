# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

### Day 1: May 24, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed conditional statements, type conversion, and format strings. Completed the Day 2 lessons and did the Day 3 text adventure project before going through the lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am pretty good at figuring out the logic behind various coding problems, it is just going to take some time to re-learn the Python syntax since I haven't programmed in quite a while.

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining lessons from Day 6, and completed additional practice problems on Reeborg's World.

Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- while loops
- functions

**Thoughts**: Didn't get nearly as much time to go through lessons and practice problems as yesterday. Solved all of the Hurdle problems, and realized my solution for the Maze problem could be used for the Hurdles as well.

### Day 4: May 27, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 7 and 8.
Topics reviewed:
- functions (with positional arguments and with keyword arguments)
- creating modules
- importing modules
- ASCII art
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Hangman
- Caeser cipher (encode/decode)

**Thoughts**: The logic behind the projects was pretty straightforward. The user interface elements and adding sanitization to areas with user input made the projects take a bit longer.

### Day 5: May 28, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 9. Solved additional Reeborg's World puzzles.
Topics reviewed:
- dictionaries
- nesting lists and dictionaries
- input validation

Reeborg's World puzzles solved:
- Home 1
- Home 2
- Home 3
- Home 4
- Around 1
- Around 1 - variable
- Around 1 - apple

- Around 3
- Around 4
- Center 1
- Center 2
- Harvest 1
- Harvest 2

Mini Projects completed:
- Caesar Cipher (improved from Day 8)
- Secret Bid Auction

**Thoughts**: Reeborg's World is a pretty fun way to practice various coding concepts and see the code in action. I would definitely recommend it to beginners (even kids). The Secret Bid Auction was a very easy project, so I extended it to add input validation, and included functionality to detect tie bids and list out all of the tied winners.

- debugging/debuggers
- random module
- ternary operator
- while loops
- format strings
- functions (with named parameters)
- dictionaries

Mini Projects completed:
- Guess the Number game
- Higher or Lower game

**Thoughts**: Number Guessing game and Higher or Lower game were both very easy to implement without needing to make an outline or flow chart. They each took less than 30 minutes to create, including some modifications I made. The debugging lessons were incredibly basic.

### Day 9: June 1, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 15 and 16.
Topics reviewed:
- IDE setup/configuration
- installing Python packages
- Procedural programming paradigm
- Object-oriented programming paradigm
- Classes
- Class attributes
- Class methods

Mini Projects completed:
- Coffee Maker (procedural)
- Coffee Maker (object-oriented)

**Thoughts**: The process of making the coffe maker program was pretty informative. Although the example program was fairly unsophisticated and lacked checks to prevent invalid user inputs from crashing the program, it gave me a good starting point and provided several features that could be added to make the program more useful and easier to interact with and test. I noticed that for the past few projects I had written several different functions to validate user inputs. I was able to refine these functions and consolidate them into two functions that are much more robust and have optional parameters that can allow them to be used for a variety of different input validation needs. get_valid_string_from_options() and get_valid_int()

### Day 10: June 2, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 17.
Topics reviewed:
- Object-oriented programming paradigm
- APIs
- Classes
- dunder methods
- lists
- dictionaries
- random.sample()

Mini Projects completed:
- Quiz Game (object-oriented)

**Thoughts**: I didn't get too much time today, but I was able to make the quiz on my own using OOP and then refine it a bit more after watching the solution video. The link that was provided to the website with the Trivia question API was really helpful for generating additional questions. The Quiz Game program could definitely be expanded to handle additional types of questions (multiple choice, fill in the blank, etc), as well as add ability for user to specify the types of questions they want to include in the quiz.

### Day 11: June 3, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 18.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- tkinter
- installing Python packages
- tuples
- random.choice()

Mini Projects completed:
- Random walk simulation 
- Dot Painting project

**Thoughts**: I was a bit rushed today and didn't get as much time to focus as I would have liked, but I was able to finish the lessons and the project. I will definitely play around with the Turtle module more in the future for practice.

### Day 12: June 4, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 19.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- event listeners
- state
- higher order functions
- race conditions

Mini Projects completed:
- Etch A Sketch
- Turtle Race

**Thoughts**: I played around with the Turtle module quite a bit. I created the basic Etch A Sketch, and then I modified it so that it worked correctly if you held down the arrow keys (rather than just moving when you press the key). I also added a boost function so you can press the space bar to double the speed. I also added toggle keys that allow you to increase the base speed and angle increment amounts higher and lower.

### Day 13: June 5, 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed project from Day 20 (the first half of the Snake game), but skipped the lessons.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics module
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection

Project worked on:
- Snake Game

**Thoughts**: I was a bit rushed today and only got a bit of time to work before bed. I didn't watch any of the video lessons but was able to get the basic of the Snake game done. So far I can make the snake move around the board, and I have a piece of food that gets generated. The collision detection isn't fully working, but if the Snake touches the food, it will be "eaten" and move to a different part of the board. It took some time to research how to properly do animations using event listeners and mainloop() in the Turtle class, because I definitely didn't do it the proper way yesterday. I was able to get the Etch A Sketch to work with an endless while loop, but after further research I found that isn't the ideal way to handle the loop with event listeners. I will have to go back and re-make the Etch A Sketch correctly in the future.

### Day 14: June 6, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed project from Day 21 (the second half of the Snake game), but skipped the lessons.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection
- boundries

Project completed:
- Snake Game

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the rest of the functionality for the Snake game (generate food in correct locations, implement collision detection correctly, detect crash with wall or tail, updating score and writing on the screen, and writing GAME OVER message). I also implemented somewehat of a developer console to allow me to debug things more easily. When I press the "Enter" key, it prompts me for code I want to evaluate, and then runs eval() on my input. This way I can easily check or set values during runtime, as well as running functions. The overall code could definitely use some polishing and refactoring to make it more consice, but that will be for another day.

### Day 15: June 7, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 20 and 21, and completed about 2/3 of the project from Day 22 (Pong) but not the lessons.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection
- boundries
- computer-controlled player

Project worked on:
- Pong

**Thoughts**: Before doing any coding, I took some time to write out the relevant classes, class attributes, and class methods I thought would be necessary to make the Pong game. This was incredibly helpful because it gave me a framework that I could work at filling in, and heped me to see all the parts of the project and how they would interact.

### Day 16: June 8, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson from Day 22 and completed the remainder of the project from Day 22 (Pong). I also revised it quite a bit and added several extra features. I didn't start working on the Day 23 project or lessons.
Topics reviewed:
- turtle graphics animations (mainloop, tracer, update)
- event listeners
- higher order functions
- inheritance
- collision detection (lots of time spent improving this)
- boundries
- computer-controlled player

Project completed:
- Pong

**Thoughts**: I spent an incredible amount of time today tweaking the collision detection for the ball and paddles to improve the gameplay and get rid of some bugs where the ball could go through the paddle if its x velocity got high enough.
