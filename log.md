# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy

**Thoughts:** Reviewed miscellaneous commands [print(), input(), len()] and variables. I was already familiar with the concepts presented, but it was a good review nonetheless. I also went ahead and did the project from Day 2 without going through the lessons yet.

### Day 1: May 24, 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed conditional statements, type conversion, and format strings. Completed the Day 2 lessons and did the Day 3 text adventure project before going through the lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am pretty good at figuring out the logic behind various coding problems, it is just going to take some time to re-learn the Python syntax since I haven't programmed in quite a while.

### Day 2: May 25, 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons from Days 3, 4, and 5, and completed the projects for Days 4, 5, and 6.
Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- lists
- random module
- for loops and while loops
- range() function
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Password generator
- Robot maze escape

**Thoughts** I've been able to complete the end of day projects before taking the lessons for the day, which shows I am still reviewing topics that I previously knew. It is encouraging that I am picking it back up so quickly.

### Day 3: May 26, 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining lessons from Day 6, and completed additional practice problems on Reeborg's World.

Topics reviewed:
- conditional statements
- while loops
- functions

**Thoughts**: Didn't get nearly as much time to go through lessons and practice problems as yesterday. Solved all of the Hurdle problems, and realized my solution for the Maze problem could be used for the Hurdles as well.

### Day 4: May 27, 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and projects from Days 7 and 8.
Topics reviewed:
- functions (with positional arguments and with keyword arguments)
- creating modules
- importing modules
- ASCII art
  
Mini Projects completed:
- Hangman
- Caeser cipher (encode/decode)

**Thoughts**: The logic behind the projects was pretty straightforward. The user interface elements and adding sanitization to areas with user input made the projects take a bit longer.

### Day 5: May 28, 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed lessons and project from Day 9. Solved additional Reeborg's World puzzles.
Topics reviewed:
- dictionaries
- nesting lists and dictionaries
- input validation

Reeborg's World puzzles solved:
- Home 1
- Home 2
- Home 3
- Home 4
- Around 1
- Around 1 - variable
- Around 1 - apple
- Around 2
- Around 3
- Around 4
- Center 1
- Center 2
- Harvest 1
- Harvest 2

Mini Projects completed:
- Caesar Cipher (improved from Day 8)
- Secret Bid Auction

**Thoughts**: Reeborg's World is a pretty fun way to practice various coding concepts and see the code in action. I would definitely recommend it to beginners (even kids). The Secret Bid Auction was a very easy project, so I extended it to add input validation, and included functionality to detect tie bids and list out all of the tied winners.
